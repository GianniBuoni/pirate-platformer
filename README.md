# 💀 Super Pirate Plaformer! 💀

Trying to put together what I've learned about making games.  
Originally written in Python, and now trying to rewrite it in Go.

## Controls

`W,A,S,D or UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN`: directional movement.
`SPACE`: jump; combine with directional inputs to wall jump.
`F`: attack; slashes sword and sends away projectiles and enemies.

## Goals

I'm using this project to learn how to put together a game with thees features:

- Menus/UI/Game Over Screen
- Overworld
- Multiple levels
