# üíÄ Super Pirate Platformer! üíÄ

Trying to put together what I've learned about making games.  
Originally written in Python, and now trying to rewrite it in Go.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Controls

| Action                  | Key Binding          | Extra Info                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Move right              | `RIGHT`, `D`, or `L` | Combo jumping to wall jump.                                                         |
| Move left               | `LEFT`, `A`, or `H`  | Combo jumping to wall jump.                                                         |
| Jump                    | `SPACE`              | N/A                                                                                 |
| Phase through platforms | `DOWN`, `S`, or `J`  | N/A                                                                                 |
| Attack                  | `F`                  | If timed right, it can reverse the direction of pearl pojectiles and tooth enemies. |

The game supports standard WASD and Arrow Key controls as well as VIM Keys for movement!  
There's the potential to add joystick controls later.

## üóíÔ∏è Goals

I'm using this project to learn how to put together a game with these features:

- ~Menus/UI/Game Over Screen~
- Overworld
- ~Multiple levels~
